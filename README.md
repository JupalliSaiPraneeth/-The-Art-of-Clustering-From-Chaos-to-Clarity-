# -The-Art-of-Clustering-From-Chaos-to-Clarity-
This project demonstrates unsupervised machine learning using clustering algorithms. It involves grouping data points based on similarity without predefined labels. Techniques like K-Means,K-Medoids,Hierarchical with Single and Complete are applied to visualize and interpret patterns within the dataset.
